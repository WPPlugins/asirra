== Description ==

Asirra is a human-interactive proof (HIP), designed to prevent automated
spam attacks. This plugin uses Asirra to protect your comments posting page.
Asirra is more difficult to attack automatically than HIPs based on squiggly
text, and also a lot more pleasant for humans to solve: rather than squiggly
text, Asirra asks guests to identify photos of cats and dogs.

== Installation ==
